One day, I saw a lady hacking rice and beans wearing Hijab. I asked her out since I saw her as someone who understands her religion very well. She answered me and I was happy. One our way home,
I saw her reciting Al-Qur'an.

                A friend sent me here to search for a rookery<br>
                of wading birds, but I haven’t found anything.<br>
                If they nested here at all, they’d be up to 90 feet high,<br>
                or buried in thickets of salt grass. Others, too, come here<br>
                when they don’t want to be found: on the guardrail<br>
                overlooking the bay, two teenage lovers<br>
                share a kiss, and then a joint, huffing<br>
                smoke into each other’s eyes, then startling<br>
                onto their backs, laughing. Late spring<br>
                a kind of emptying out: why<br>
                do I imagine they’re saying their goodbyes?

        This week’s unseasonable frost killed
        the magnolia before bloom. Brittle-brown
        frostbuds waiting to drop.

        On his podcast, Joe says take notes,
        record observations. Keep track
        of changes over your lifetime,

        your children’s, your grandchildren’s.
        Through the open window, a train whistle,
        fire trucks, and the laughter

        of children across the creek, a creek so small
        Google Maps doesn’t register it as water.
        I always take the same photo,

        though there will be no children, no
        grandchildren—whose lifetime, then,
        is this for? I give myself permission

        to be supremely selfish. At the creek, a catbird
        on a cairn. Crabs skitter across the muddy
        shoreline. Felled trees will become the pages
        where we chart swells and falls, flames and ashes.

        Many compounds have the ability to crystallize with some having different crystal structures,
        a phenomenon called polymorphism.
        Certain polymorphs may be metastable, meaning that although it is not in thermodynamic equilibrium.
        It is kinetically stable and requires some input of energy to initiate a transformation to the equilibrium phase.
        Each polymorph is in fact a different thermodynamic solid state and crystal polymorphs of the same compound exhibit different physical properties, such as dissolution rate, shape (angles between facets and facet growth rates), melting point, etc.
        For this reason, polymorphism is of major importance in industrial manufacture of crystalline products.
        Additionally, crystal phases can sometimes be interconverted by varying factors such as temperature, such as in the transformation of anatase to rutile phases of titanium dioxide.
